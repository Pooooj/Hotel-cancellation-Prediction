As part of my Post Graduate Diploma in Artificial Intelligence and Machine Learning from Texas McCombs University, I've been delving into a fascinating case study on hotel booking cancellations. Today, I'm thrilled to share some key insights and developments from this project!

ðŸŽ¯ AI Workflow and Deployment Results ðŸŽ¯

In our exploration, we leveraged advanced AI techniques to analyze booking data and predict the likelihood of cancellations. Through thorough Exploratory Data Analysis (EDA), meticulous data preprocessing, and model training, we developed a robust Decision Tree Classifier capable of predicting cancellations with high accuracy. Additionally, we fine-tuned our model using GridSearchCV to optimize performance and ensure it could generalize well to unseen data while maintaining high accuracy. Rigorous testing validated our model's efficacy, with an impressive accuracy score of approximately 80% on test data. The culmination of our efforts led to the deployment of our predictive model, accessible via an intuitive Gradio interface. Now, stakeholders can effortlessly assess the likelihood of booking cancellations in real-time.

ðŸ“Š Key Findings and Insights ðŸ“Š

Our analysis revealed intriguing insights, including the impact of lead time and arrival month on cancellation rates. Notably, January and December exhibited significantly lower cancellation rates compared to other months, offering valuable insights for revenue management strategies.

ðŸ’¡ Next Steps ðŸ’¡

As we move forward, we'll continue to monitor and refine our model, ensuring it remains effective in dynamic real-world scenarios. Additionally, we'll explore avenues for enhancing predictive capabilities and expanding the scope of our AI solutions.
